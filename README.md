Path of Exile chromatic currency mechanic is a bit unintuative and complex. The outcome depends on weighted randomness, but since the outcome cannot repeat twice in a row, it is a bit more complicated to calculate the probabilities.

This is a tool I made for fun in my spare time to handle the markov chain calculation.
